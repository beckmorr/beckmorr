# Hi, I'm Anderson

### A newcomer 🐣 to the world of computer science

I am a Computer Science student at Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz (UESC), located in Ilhéus, Bahia, Brazil. Currently, I am focused on expanding my knowledge in **Python**, **data analysis**, and **game development**.

I have a strong interest in exploring how technology can be applied to solve real-world problems, and I am always on the lookout for new challenges that allow me to grow as a developer and data scientist.

Here on GitHub, you’ll find projects that reflect my interests, ranging from Python scripts for data manipulation to small initiatives in simple game development. Feel free to explore.
