# Hi, I'm Anderson

### A newcomer 🐣 to the world of computer science

I am a Computer Science student at Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz (UESC), located in Ilhéus, Bahia, Brazil. Currently, I am focused on expanding my knowledge in **Python**, **C**, and **computer systems design** including **assembly language** and **digital logic circuits**.

I have a strong interest in exploring how technology can be applied to solve real-world problems, and I am always on the lookout for new challenges that allow me to grow as a developer.
